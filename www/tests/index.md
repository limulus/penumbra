# Tests

[The Ray Tracer Challenge] guides you to write a ray tracer using test driven development.
It provides tests written in Gherkin, and you write the tests and implementation in the
language of your choice. I’ve translated them to run as BDD tests in Mocha. You can [run
them in your browser](./runner/).
